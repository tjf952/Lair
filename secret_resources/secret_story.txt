Ayo, it all started with a gingerbread hot cocoa that had us like, “gyatttt” and a whole lotta “let’s just send it” vibes. It was this crisp morning when we met up at a coffee shop for what we thought was gonna be a lowkey first date. Plot twist: that one cocoa hit so different, it unlocked a whole day we didn’t wanna end.

Next stop? A farmers' market that was straight BUSSIN’ — we were out here cracking jokes, matching energies, and realizing the rizz was undeniable. Hours flew by, and we were like, “nah, we ain’t done yet.” So, we pulled up to a bowling alley where Thomas def tried flexing the skills like a skibidi sigma, say less. Then we hit an art museum, telling goofy stories and roasting random paintings, before finishing with a big-brain movie marathon: Toy Story 4 and Knives Out. Popcorn? Check. Ice cream? Check. Nonstop vibes? Say less. From 8 a.m. to 11 p.m., we were just out here thrivin’.

That day set the tone: straight serotonin, mad connection, and top-tier adventures. Whether we’re hiking trails with views that make you go, “oh fr?!”, pulling road trips with the AUX on blast, or just vibing at home over fire snacks, we’re always living our best lives together.

The most GOATED memory? Easy. That Cali road trip where Thomas brought max rizz and proposed every single day of the trip. Like, HELLO?! Who’s doing it like him? Nobody, fr. He was standing on business for her, no cap. The whole trip was big love, big vibes, and a lil plot twist energy.

Now we’re counting down to October 25, 2025, in Bluffton, SC — it’s gonna be a certified banger. We’re so hyped to celebrate with our day ones and real ones who’ve been cheering us on since day one. From that first gyatt-worthy cocoa to all the adventures still ahead, we’re blessed to have y’all in the squad. On God. Let’s get this bread! We in motion now!
