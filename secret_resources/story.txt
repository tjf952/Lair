The air was crisp that day, the kind of chill that makes you bundle up and take notice of the world around you. Through a window, the fiery hues of autumn leaves danced in the breeze, and the hum of campus life swirled in the background. Amid the movement, their eyes met through the glass of a door—her glance brimming with a spark of curiosity, his smile a quiet, unspoken “wow.”

When their hands touched for the first time, it was as if the universe held its breath. A spark arced between them, something magical and electric, a tangled rush of nerves and wonder. In that moment, the world narrowed to just the two of them: Thomas and Kathryn, meeting for the very first time.

Minutes later, a cup of hot cocoa exchanged hands. She offered it, a small, simple gesture, not knowing it would become the first ripple in a tidal wave. He accepted it, fingers curling around the warmth of the cup, but it was her effort, her thoughtfulness, that warmed him even more. That small act was the beginning of a day neither of them would want to see end.

Their first day together felt like stepping into a storybook. They wandered through aisles of old books, laughed under the neon haze of an underground bowling alley, shared pupusas at a bustling farmer’s market, and explored eras of art, testing each other’s humor and hearts along the way. As the sun dipped lower, they ignored the clock. Daylight remained, and neither could bear to say goodbye.

Instead, they watched movies on campus, shared the novelty of gluten-free pasta, indulged in milkshakes, and lingered at the campus center, talking until the stars came out. And when the time finally came to part ways, their stares lingered, hesitant, like watching the sun slip away before a moonless night. Neither of them said it aloud, but they felt it, the first gentle bloom of love.

In the years that followed, that love grew like an ever-blooming garden, tended by laughter, effort, and the intertwining of lives. Families and friends wove into their story, a tapestry of shared love and joy. They became each other’s Player Two in every aspect, celebrating victory royales, conquering escape rooms, and overcoming the challenges of life. When one stumbled, the other held fast, offering strength and a hand to pull them up.

Together, they built a life of adventures. They explored the Blue Ridge Mountains, riding horses, harvesting apples, and resting by the warmth of campfires. They shared childhood dreams at Disney World, the happiest place on Earth for her 21st birthday. They accepted their letters to Hogwarts at Universal Studios, finally stepping into the wizarding world they’d dreamed of.

Then there was the cross-country road trip, a journey spanning over 4,000 miles, six national parks, and countless memories. From the shores of Lake Wylie to the towering heights of Angel’s Landing, Thomas proposed to Kathryn not just once but twelve times, each moment a promise of forever. Most recently, they escaped to the tranquility of Hawaii. Here, they paused to breathe and celebrate the achievements they worked so hard for.

And amidst the grand adventures, there were quiet, heartfelt moments that mattered just as much. The simple meals and treats they made for each other, the outstretched hand to join each other in a walk or dance, and the prepared spot on a couch to cuddle up and watch a movie. Through these moments, love was chosen and a silent promise made for a desire of eternity.

Now, as they prepare for their wedding on October 25, 2025, in Bluffton, SC, they look back on their journey with gratitude. From that first sip of gingerbread hot cocoa to the countless adventures yet to come, they are thankful for every person who has been part of their story.

For their love is not a single spark, but a constellation, a collection of small, shining moments that, together, create a lifetime of light.
